/*
Problem Statement:
-----------------
Given an array of integers of size N and a number K., Your must modify array arr[] exactly K number of times. 
Here modify array means in each operation you can replace any array element either arr[i] by -arr[i] or -arr[i] by arr[i]. 
You need to perform this operation in such a way that after K operations, the sum of the array must be maximum.

Example 1:
---------
Input:
N = 5, K = 1
arr[] = {1, 2, -3, 4, 5}
Output:
15
Explanation: We have k=1 so we can change -3 to 3 and sum all the elements to produce 15 as output.

Example 2:
---------
Input:
N = 10, K = 5
arr[] = {5, -2, 5, -4, 5, -12, 5, 5, 5, 20}
Output:
68
Explanation: Here  we have k=5 so we turn -2, -4, -12 to 2, 4, and 12 respectively. Since we have performed 3 operations so k is now 2. To get
maximum sum of array we can turn positive turned 2 into negative and then positive again so k is 0. Now sum is 5+5+4+5+12+5+5+5+20+2 = 68

Your Task: You don't have to print anything, print ting is done by the driver code itself. You have to complete the function maximizeSum() which takes the array A[], 
its size N, and an integer K as inputs and returns the maximum possible sum.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

        int min = *min_element(a , a+n);
        
        if(k %2 != 0)
            sum -= (2*min);

        return sum;
    }

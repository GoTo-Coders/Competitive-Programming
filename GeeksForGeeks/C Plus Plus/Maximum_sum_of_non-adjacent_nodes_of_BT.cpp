/*
Problem Statement:
-----------------
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that the sum of chosen nodes is maximum 
under a constraint that no two chosen node in the subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take any of its children 
in consideration and vice versa.

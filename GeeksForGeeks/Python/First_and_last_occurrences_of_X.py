"""
Given a sorted array having N elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of an element X in the given array.
Note: If the number X is not found in the array, return '-1' as an array.

Example 1:
---------
Input:
N = 4 , X = 3
arr[] = { 1, 3, 3, 4 }
Output:
1 2
Explanation: For the above array, first occurence of X = 3 is at index = 1 and last occurence is at index = 2.

Example 2:
----------
Input:
N = 4, X = 5
arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
Output:
-1
Explanation: As 5 is not present in the array, so the answer is -1.

Your Task: You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function firstAndLast() that takes the array arr, its size N and the value X as 
input parameters and returns a list of integers containing the indices of first and last occurence of X.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

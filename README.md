## Our Goal:
The goal of this project is to have in a single place for all possible **Competitive Programming Solution** - in multiple languages. 
We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.
Our organization provides a common platform where all the passionate coders can contribute and uplift themselves as well as the organization.  
It is our goal to provide access to well written, well-explained programs and knowledge that improve people's lives. 
We want to enable people to adapt and change code according to their own ideas through an Open Access approach. 
We bring amazing people together to code algorithms and share our work for the benefit of all.
